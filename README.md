Doc2Vec On The WikiVoyage Corpus


Motivation: I love to travel, especially to offbeat/out-of-the-way/unusual places

Challenge: Discovering these places is still a highly manual process

Currently relies on:
Folk knowledge
Word of mouth (hopefully your friends have some good recommendations)
Random discovery (reading the right article, watching the right travel show)
Wandering

Goal: To develop a system to help people discover new places to travel to.

How: Use the Wikivoyage corpus (currently only North America and Europe) to train a Doc2Vec model and then use cosine similarity to generate new travel ideas based on places and topics that we feed into the model
