      "Aberdeen is called the \"Gateway to the Olympic Peninsula,\" because of its proximity to the southern end of the peninsula and to Olympic National Park. In recent history Aberdeen has become more famous as being the \"Birthplace of Grunge,\" and the hometown of Nirvana members Kurt Cobain and Krist Novoselic. A sign welcoming visitors to Aberdeen proclaims \"Come As You Are\" as a tribute to the band. Although it's hard to imagine today, at one point Aberdeen was a notorious Western outpost at the turn of the 20th century, with a number of saloons, brothels, and gambling halls in and around the town. Because of the wild atmosphere associated with these establishments, Aberdeen was nicknamed \"The Hellhole of the Pacific.\"\n",

From Seattle, Interstate 5 provides access to Olympia, where you can take State Route 8 to U.S. Route 12 west into the city.\n",
