The NYT sections (topics) are great, but we don't know how they relate to patterns in article content.  Let us see what insights we can mine out of our corpus!  We will be starting with our bag of words matrix. Use the same articles we have been using all along now.\n",

Use the [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) from scikit-learn (or Tfidf) to turn the content of the news stories into a document-term matrix.  Choose a reasonable value (like 5000) for max_features when initializing the vectorizer.\n",
